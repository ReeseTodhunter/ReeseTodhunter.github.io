                        This Procedural Animator was created as my individal reasearch project during my final year of university.
                        It utilizes Inverse Kinematics to calculate the positions to move a character's leg nodes to reach a target.

                                <h3>Armature</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The basic armature is built up of a set of nodes used to create a "leg".
                                    Upon startup each node defines the distance between itself and the next node in sequence, saving the distance as it's bone length.
                                    The nodes are then moved towards a target position, starting from the target using some vector maths to position the nodes. 
                                    Once placed in their appropriate positions this is then repeated in reverse, 
                                    starting from the node connected to the creature's torso and working back along the chain of nodes to position them in the correct order.
                                    
                                </p>

                                            The player controller is built to function as a top down character with multiple weapon and powerup 
                                            capabilities which can be swapped out and changed at run time.<br/>
                                            The controller inherits from a "Character" base class, which holds the base methods for things such as: Healing, Taking Damage, Death and Status Effects. <br/>
                                            Along side all of their repective variables.<br/>

                                            The weapons within the game are built upon 2 of 3 base classes.<br/>
                                            The Base Weapon class holds all of the base requirements for any weapon within the game such as the weapon audio,
                                            different weapon reticles and each weapon's flavour/pickup text.<br/>
                                            This class also contains virtual functions for all firing and reloading scripts acting as a template class for other weapon bases.<br/>
                                            This Base Weapon Class can be seen below.<br/>

                                            These classes serve as the actual base for most weapons within the game, containing the complete functions for firing and reloading.
                                            This allows for the easy creation and itteration of new weapons from these base classes.<br/>

                                            Conversely, modifiers are stored as a dictionary of values, these can then be called to when applied to players or enemies.
                                            When collected by the player the modifier checks the dictionary for the selected modifier then checks the range for the modifier's variance.<br/>
                                            Once this is done the modifier's Type and value are added to a list of modifiers on the player character.
                                            When actions are then called on the player the appropriate modifiers are then taken from this list and applied to the action. <br/>

                                    leaderboards, achievement management and sound systems implemented during the game's development.<br/>
